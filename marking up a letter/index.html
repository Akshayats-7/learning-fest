    <h1><strong>Oxford university application </strong></h1>

    <p>Dear Jane,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Oxford
    faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD </abbr> next year.</p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>

    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; 
    the start dates.</p>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

    <p>You can find more information about <a href="https://abc.com">important university dates</a>  on our website.</p>

    <h2>Subjects of study
    
    </h2>

    <p>
        At the Oxford Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility â€” 
        as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. 
        You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like 
        to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>


    <ol>
        <li>Turning H <sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C <sub>14</sub>H <sub>12</sub>O <sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size 
            exponentially increases.
        <li> <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Dr Jane</p>
